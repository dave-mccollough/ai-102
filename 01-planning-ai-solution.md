Once trained, the LLM can take an input (called a prompt) and generate coherent, context-aware output in response.# Planning an Azure AI solution

- Generative AI
  - Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content — such as text, images, music, code, or videos — rather than just analyzing or classifying existing data. It’s called “generative” because it generates outputs that didn’t exist before, often resembling human-created work.

- What are LLMs
  - LLMs, or Large Language Models, are a type of artificial intelligence system that can understand, generate, and reason about human language.
  - They’re the core technology behind tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude
  - The model is fed huge amounts of text data and learns statistical relationships between words (for example, “coffee” is often near “cup” or “morning”).
  - Most modern LLMs are built using a type of neural network called a Transformer — introduced by Google in 2017 — which excels at understanding context across long stretches of text.
  - Once trained, the LLM can take an input (called a prompt) and generate coherent, context-aware output in response.
  - LLMs are the language focused part of generative AI

- Multi-modal LLM
  - Multimodal LLMs are large language models that can process and generate more than one type of data, not just text
    - Text
    - Images
    - Audio
    - Video
    - Code
